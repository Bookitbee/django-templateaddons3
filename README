******************************
Builtin template tag libraries
******************************

This application provides several template tags.

Heading
=======

The "heading" template tag library provides 1 template tag:

* headingcontext: helps you manage heading levels in HTML code

headingcontext
--------------

With cascading templates, includes and bases, some parts of template code
could be reused in different heading contexts.

As an example, consider the following "home page" code in home.html::

  <h1>My beautiful website</h1>
  <h2>News</h2>
  <p>... links to news ...</p>

And consider the following "news page" code in news.html

  <h1>News</h1>
  <p>... links to news ...</p>

You cannot reuse (include) news.html code into home.html, because the heading
level does not match.

The "headingcontext" allows you to solve this problem.
Here is modified home.html::

  {% load heading %}
  <h1>My beautiful website</h1>
  {% headingcontext %}
  {% include "news.html" %}
  {% endheadingcontext %}   

Use this template tag in almost all your templates, or you may get some 
inconsistency with levels.

In fact, if you use this template tag, you should:

* use it after every heading
* write every heading as if it was a h1

Settings
========

* add 'templateaddons' to your INSTALLED_APPS
